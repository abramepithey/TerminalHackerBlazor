# Terminal Hacker Blazor

#### This is a remake of a console application I made while learning C#, created using Blazor WebAssembly.

Completed over the course of just a few days, the purpose of the project was to learn a new framework, Blazor WASM, and become more comfortable integrating with Azure.

Potential future plans for the project include separating the application out with an API, and utilizing that within various other technologies.
