# Terminal Hacker Blazor

#### This is a remake of a console application I made while learning C#, created using Blazor WebAssembly.

While still a work in progress, the purpose of the project is to learn a new framework, Blazor WASM, and become more comfortable integrating with Azure.

Future plans for the project include separating the application out with an API, and utilizing that within various other technologies.

I am currently testing two different hosting options, both on Azure.

The first is a Static Web App, which works very well with GitHub to keep the hosted project up-to-date.

The second is a more traditional Web Application, which is slightly more work to keep up-to-date, but much more stable.
